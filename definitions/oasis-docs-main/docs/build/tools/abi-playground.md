# ABI Playground

The [ABI Playground][abi-playground] provides an interactive environment for
working with verified smart contracts on Oasis networks. Similar to Etherscan's
read/write contract functionality, you can execute functions on verified
contracts deployed to the Sapphire and Emerald networks.

If your contract isn't verified yet, please see our [verification] chapter.

## Access Verified Contracts

You can access verified contracts in two ways:

### Method 1: via Explorer

1. Navigate to the [Explorer].
2. Search for a verified contract using its address, e.g. Wrapped ROSE:
   `0x8Bc2B030b299964eEfb5e1e0b36991352E56D2D3`.
3. Click `Interact in ABI Playground`.

4. The ABI Playground will open with the Wrapped ROSE contract loaded.

### Method 2: Direct ABI Playground Access

1. Visit the [ABI Playground][abi-playground].
2. Enter a verified contract address, e.g., Wrapped ROSE:
   `0x8Bc2B030b299964eEfb5e1e0b36991352E56D2D3`.
3. Click `Load Contract`.

4. The ABI Playground will open with the Wrapped ROSE contract loaded.

## Working with Localnet Contracts

The ABI Playground also supports interacting with contracts deployed on a
[localnet] for testing purposes.

1. Visit the [ABI Playground][abi-playground].
2. Select `Oasis Saphhire Localnet` from the network dropdown.

3. Enter address of the contract you deployed on localnet.
4. Paste the ABI JSON into the provided text field.
5. Click `Import ABI` to load the interface.

:::info Finding Your Contract's ABI

When using development frameworks:

- Hardhat: Look in the `artifacts` directory
- Foundry: Check the `out` directory

If you encounter format errors, validate your ABI JSON using an online
formatter before importing.

## Troubleshooting

### Contract address not found

  - **Cause**: The contract might not be verified on Sourcify or the address is incorrect.
  - **Solution**: Verify the contract on Sourcify or double-check the address.

### Invalid ABI format

  - **Cause**: The ABI JSON might not be following standard formatting.
  - **Solution**: Use an online JSON formatter to validate and reformat the ABI before importing it.
