# Cipher ParaTime

Cipher is a confidential ParaTime for executing Wasm smart contracts.

As an officially supported ParaTime by the Oasis Protocol Foundation, Cipher
allows for:

* Flexibility: developer can define which data to store in a public
  and which data in the (more expensive) confidential storage
* Security: the [Rust language] primarily used for writing Wasm smart contracts
  is known for its strict memory management and was developed specifically to
  avoid memory leaks
* Scalability: increased throughput of transactions
* Low-cost: 99%+ lower fees than Ethereum
* 6 second finality (1 block)
* Cross-chain bridge to enable cross-chain interoperability (upcoming)

If you're looking for EVM-compatible ParaTimes, check out the
[Emerald](../emerald/README.mdx) and the confidential
[Sapphire](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime/blob/main/docs/README.mdx) paratimes.

## Smart Contract Development

Cipher implements the [Oasis Contract SDK] API. To learn how to write a
confidential smart contract in Rust and deploy it on Cipher, read the related
