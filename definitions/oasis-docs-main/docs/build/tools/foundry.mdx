# Foundry

[Foundry] is a smart contract development environment
for EVM-based chains. This guide will show you how to use Foundry to build,
test, and deploy smart contracts on Oasis Sapphire.

:::info

For comprehensive details about Foundry's features, consult the
[Foundry documentation].

:::

Foundry contains the following tools:

- **Forge** is a CLI [tool] for building, testing,
and deploying smart contracts.
Due to integrated Revm it significantly increases runtime speed when testing.

- **Anvil** is a local development EVM [node].
It is installed as part of Foundry, but currently cannot
be extended with Sapphire features.

- **Cast** is a [CLI tool] for interacting with EVM nodes.
It uses RPC calls, so it can be used
to interact with Sapphire nodes running the [Oasis Web3 gateway].

- **Chisel** is a Solidity [REPL] (short for "read-eval-print loop")
that allows developers to write and test Solidity code snippets.
It provides an interactive environment for writing and executing
Solidity code, as well as a set of built-in commands for working
with and debugging your code.


## Setup and Configuration

Follow the steps below to setup your project:

1. Install and run Foundryup:

   ```shell
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Create a new Forge project and move inside:

   ```shell
   forge init sapphire_demo
   cd sapphire_demo
   ```

3. **Sapphire Contracts** package contains
helper solidity contracts and libraries that enable convenient access to
on-chain data and precompiles (rng, signatures, on-chain encryption, etc.).
After intializing the project, we can install the **Sapphire Contracts**
package using Foundry package manager [Soldeer]:

   ```shell
   forge soldeer install @oasisprotocol-sapphire-contracts~0.2.14
   ```

### Installing Sapphire Foundry (Optional)

If you intend to use Sapphire features in Forge tests/scripts
follow this section.

Forge tests use [Revm], an EVM implementation which does not contain
[Sapphire-specific features].
For that reason, we have to install special Sapphire precompiles which are
available in the **Sapphire foundry** package.


1. Install the **Sapphire Foundry** Soldeer package:

   ```shell
   forge soldeer install @oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry~0.1.1
   ```

2. Your foundry.toml file should now look like this:

   ```toml title="foundry.toml"
   [profile.default]
   src = "src"
   out = "out"
   libs = ["lib", "dependencies"]
   // highlight-start
   ffi = true
   
   [dependencies]
   "@oasisprotocol-sapphire-contracts" = "0.2.14"
   "@oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry" = "0.1.1"
   // highlight-end
   ```

   Note:
      - `ffi = true` enables `vm.ffi()` ([foreign function interface])
      which is used to call rust bindings containing the precompile and
      decryption logic
      - `"dependencies"` lists the required project dependencies installed
      via the Foundry package manager [Soldeer]
      - (Alternative) You can also skip previous steps, copy the contents
      to your foundry.toml file and run:

      ```shell
      forge soldeer install
      ```

3. Install rust toolchain (nightly):

   ```shell
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustup toolchain install nightly
   rustup default nightly
   ```

   Note: `oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry` relies on Oasis Sapphire
   `runtime-sdk` crate which requires nightly toolchain.

4. Install Sapphire precompiles:
   ```shell
   cd dependencies/@oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry-0.1.1/precompiles
   cargo +nightly build --release
   ```

## Sapphire-specific Tests

Users who aren't familiar with confidential benefits of Sapphire
should take a moment to review the Ethereum [comparison page].
The `@oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry` package enables
testing with precompiles and encrypted calls.

### Precompiles

Sapphire precompiles are special precompiled contracts that
contain cryptographic primitives and enable confidential transactions.
Since Foundry uses un-customized Revm, they are not available by default.

To enable them in Forge tests, add the **import** statement to your test file:

```solidity
import {SapphireTest} from "@oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry-0.1.1/BaseSapphireTest.sol";
```

and then inherit from `SapphireTest` from `BaseSapphireTest.sol`
and override the `setUp()` function:

```solidity
contract PrecompileTest is SapphireTest {
   
   function setUp() public override {
      super.setUp();
   }
```

### Encrypted Transactions and Calls

Sapphire uses end-to-end encryption for confidential transactions and calls.
This means that the calldata is encrypted using the shared [key].
For non-encrypted transactions, the process works same as on Ethereum.
However, when testing for example [gasless transactions] with Foundry,
we need to add a few things.

After deploying the precompiles in the previous step, we need to
update our custom contract, encrypt the transaction and broadcast it.

1. `SapphireDecryptor` is a special contract that implements decryption
through the fallback function.
We need to inherit from it to enable decryption.

   ```solidity
   import {SapphireDecryptor} from "@oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry-0.1.1/BinaryContracts.sol";

   contract CustomContract is SapphireDecryptor {
   ```

2. See [examples/foundry] for this step to see
how to test encrypted gasless transaction.

3. `vm.broadcastRawTransaction(raw_tx)` to send the raw transaction.


### `forge test`

To run tests add a new file in the `tests/` directory. Run tests with:
```shell
forge test
```

example.

## Forge Script

To run a script add a new file in the `scripts/` directory.
Run scripts with:

```shell
forge script
```

### Broadcasting transactions

**When broadcasting to Mainnet/Testnet/Localnet we do
not use any imports and contracts described in the
[Installing Sapphire Foundry (Optional)](#installing-sapphire-foundry-optional)**

When running scripts, we may also want to deploy and test on
Localnet/Testnet/Mainnet using `--broadcast` and `--rpc-url` flags.
The issue with Foundry, when broadcasting
Forge ***scripts*** is, that it only broadcasts state-changing transactions.
This means that none of ***view calls*** are sent through the RPC node.
They are still executed in the local in-memory Revm even when
`--broadcast` and `--skip-simulation` flags are provided.

Using Forge script we can deploy and broadcast transactions on Sapphire
just like on Ethereum, but since most Sapphire features are enabled
through precompile ***view calls*** we then have to use `vm.rpc()`
cheatcode to query data directly.

This code contains Forge Script contract, that calls
**RANDOM_BYTES (0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000001)** precompile
directly using `vm.rpc()`:

```solidity
   contract CounterScript is Script {

    function setUp() public {
        vm.createSelectFork("https://testnet.sapphire.oasis.io");
    }

    function run() public {
      vm.startBroadcast();
      string memory transactionArgs = string.concat(
         "[{\"to\":\"", "0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000001",
         "\",\"data\":\"", vm.toString(abi.encode(32, "")),
         "\"}, \"latest\"]"
      );
      bytes memory result = vm.rpc("eth_call", transactionArgs);
      vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
   }
```

### A Note on Fork testing

Due to encrypted state, it is not possible to fork Sapphire.
Using Forge with `--fork-block-number` will not work.

## Verification with Foundry

After contracts are deployed, you can verify them with Sourcify.
