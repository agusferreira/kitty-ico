# Remote Signer for Oasis Node Keys

The [Oasis remote signer][oasis-core-remote-signer] is an application that
contains logic for various Oasis Core signers. Currently, only the file-based
signer is implemented, but support for hardware signers is in the works. Access
to the remote signer is provided via a gRPC service through which the Oasis node
can connect to it and request signatures.

This chapter will describe how to install the Oasis remote signer and then
configure your Oasis node to use it. We will use two separate physical machines
for deployment:

- a `server` which will function as a system running the Oasis node,
- a `signer-server` which will run the Oasis remote signer and store the node
  keys.

**These are advanced instructions intended for node operators that want to
increase the security of their validator nodes.**

:::tip

This chapter describes a tool to remotely access the [node keys] (i.e.
`beacon.pem`, `consensus.pem`, `identity.pem`, `p2p.pem`...). There is another
[`oasis wallet remote-signer`] Oasis CLI command which enables remote access to
your [entity key] and should not be confused with.

## Prerequisites

Before we continue, make sure you've followed the [Install Oasis Node Binary]
chapter and have the Oasis node binary installed on your system.

[Install Oasis Node Binary]: ../prerequisites/oasis-node.md

## Install Oasis Remote Signer Binary

The Oasis remote signer is part of the [Oasis Core][oasis-core-remote-signer].
You can either download the binary or compile it from source and then copy it
over to your `signer-server` system.

:::info

The Oasis remote signer is currently only supported on x86_64 Linux systems.

:::

### Downloading a Binary Release

The Oasis remote signer binary is part of the **Oasis Core release bundle**.
Links to the latest releases are on the Network Parameters page ([Mainnet],
[Testnet]). The Oasis remote signer binary inside the release bundle is called
`oasis-remote-signer`. You should always use the version of the remote signer
matching the version of your Oasis node.

[Mainnet]: ../../mainnet/README.md
[Testnet]: ../../testnet/README.md

### Building From Source

Follow the [Oasis Core's Build Environment Setup and Building][oasis-core-build]
chapter. After the Oasis Core is compiled, the `oasis-remote-signer` binary
should be located in the `go/oasis-remote-signer` subdirectory.

:::caution

The code in the current [`master`] branch may be incompatible with the code used
by other nodes on the network. Make sure to use the version specified on the
Network Parameters page ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).

:::

[oasis-core-build]: ../../../core/development-setup/build-environment-setup-and-building
[`master`]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/tree/master/

### Adding `oasis-remote-signer` Binary to `PATH`

To install the `oasis-remote-signer` binary for the current user, copy/symlink
it to `~/.local/bin`.

To install the `oasis-remote-signer` binary for all users of the system, copy
it to `/usr/local/bin`.

## Set Up Remote Signer System

### Initialize Remote Signer

On `signer-server`, create a directory for the remote signer, e.g.
`remote-signer`, by running:

```
mkdir --mode=700 remote-signer
```

Then, generate the [node keys] and the server certificate by running:

```
oasis-remote-signer init --datadir remote-signer/
```

Also, generate the remote signer's client certificate which will be used by
the Oasis node to connect to the remote signer:

```
oasis-remote-signer init_client --datadir remote-signer/
```

### Run Remote Signer

Choose the gRPC port on which the remote signer will listen for client requests
and run:

```
oasis-remote-signer \
--datadir remote-signer \
--client.certificate remote-signer/remote_signer_client_cert.pem \
--grpc.port <REMOTE-SIGNER-PORT> \
--log.level DEBUG
```

:::tip

The Oasis Remote Signer is configured to run in the foreground by default.

We recommend you configure and use it with a process manager like [systemd] or
[Supervisor].  Check out the [System Configuration] page for examples.

[Supervisor]: http://supervisord.org

### Copy Remote Signer Certificate, Client Key and Certificate

In order for the Oasis node to securely connect to the Oasis remote signer and
be able to demonstrate its authenticity, you need to copy the following files
from `signer-server` to `server` inside the `/node/data/remote-signer`
directory:

* `remote-signer/remote_signer_server_cert.pem`: The remote signer's
  certificate. This certificate ensures the Oasis node system is connecting to
  the trusted remote signer system.
* `remote-signer/remote_signer_client_key.pem`: The remote signer's client key.
  This key enables the Oasis node system to demonstrate its authenticity when it
  is requesting signatures from the remote signer system.
* `remote-signer/remote_signer_client_cert.pem`: The remote signer's client
  certificate. This certificate is the counterpart of the remote signer's client
  key.

## Configuration

When [configuring your Oasis Node](../validator-node.mdx#configuration)
on `server`, you need to add the appropriate `signer` section to configure the
**composite** and **remote** signers. For example:

```yaml
# Signer.
signer:
  backend: composite
  # Use file-based signer for entity, node and P2P keys and remote signer for the
  # consensus key.
  composite:
    backends: entity:file,node:file,p2p:file,consensus:remote
  # Configure how to connect to the Oasis Remote Signer.
  remote:
    address: <YOUR-REMOTE-SIGNER-IP>:<YOUR-REMOTE-SIGNER-PORT>
    server:
      certificate: /node/data/remote-signer/remote_signer_server_cert.pem
    client:
      key: /node/data/remote-signer/remote_signer_client_key.pem
      certificate: /node/data/remote-signer/remote_signer_client_cert.pem
```

This assumes you've copied the remote signer's certificate and remote signer's
client key and certificate to the `/node/data/remote-signer/` directory.

## Starting the Oasis node

[Start the Oasis node] using the modified config above. To ensure that your
Oasis node will be able to sign consensus transactions, check that the Oasis
remote signer is running and accepting remote client connections via the
designated port.

:::info

The `/node/data` directory on `server` will only have `consensus_pub.pem` and no
`consensus.pem` since the consensus key is backed by the Oasis remote signer.
