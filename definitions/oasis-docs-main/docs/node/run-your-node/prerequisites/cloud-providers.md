# Cloud Providers

Before committing to a service be sure to verify the processor compatibility and
enquire with the provider about the status of Intel SGX support. Intel maintains
a comprehensive list of processors that support Intel SGX:

## Possible Limitations

While many bare-metal or dedicated server providers use Intel processors that
support SGX, there are potential limitations:

 * **BIOS Configuration:** Some providers may not allow customers to access or
    modify BIOS settings, which may be necessary to correctly configure Intel
    SGX.
 * **Outdated Firmware:** SGX requires up-to-date firmware. Some providers may
    not maintain their systems with the latest firmware updates, preventing SGX from functioning correctly.
 * **Lack of SGX-specific Offerings:** Many providers may not advertise or
    specifically offer SGX-enabled servers, making it difficult for customers to
    know if the feature is available.
 * **Limited Support:** Even if SGX is available, the provider's support team
    may not be familiar with SGX-specific issues or configurations.
 * **Hardware Provisioning:** If you use keys (such as SGX sealing keys) that
    are bound to hardware to encrypt the data of an instance within an Intel SGX
    enclave, the encrypted data cannot be decrypted after the host of the
    instance is changed.
