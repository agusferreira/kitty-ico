# Set up Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

Most Oasis ParaTimes and ROFLs are configured to run in a TEE. There are two
kinds of Intel TEEs currently in use:

- [Intel SGX] is required by the ParaTimes and [ROFL SGX][rofl-types] apps.
- [Intel TDX] is required by the [ROFL TDX raw and container-based][rofl-types]
  apps.

To run SGX/TDX enclaves:

1. your hardware must have SGX/TDX support,
2. you must have the latest BIOS updates installed,
3. you must have SGX/TDX enabled in your BIOS,
4. you must have the Linux kernel, drivers and software components properly
   installed and running.

## Software Guard Extensions (SGX) {#sgx}

### BIOS Configuration {#sgx-bios-configuration}

To enable Intel SGX on your hardware, you also need to configure the BIOS.
First, **update the BIOS to the latest version with the latest microcode** and
then proceed with BIOS configuration as shown below. Note that some settings may
not apply to your BIOS. In that case, configure only the relevant ones. Please
set the BIOS settings as follows:

- **SGX**: ENABLE
- **Hyper-Threading**: DISABLE
- **Intel SpeedStep**: DISABLE
- **Turbo Mode**: DISABLE
- **CPU AES**: ENABLE
- **SGX Auto MP Registration**: ENABLE

### Ensure Clock Synchronization

Due to additional sanity checks within runtime enclaves, you should ensure that
the node's local clock is synchronized (e.g. using NTP). If it is off by more
than half a second you may experience unexpected runtime aborts.

### Ensure Proper SGX Device Permissions

Make sure that the user that is running the Oasis Node binary has access to the
SGX device (e.g. `/dev/sgx_enclave`). This can usually be achieved by adding
the user into the right group, for example in case the permissions of the SGX
device are as follows:

```
crw-rw---- 1 root sgx 10, 125 Oct 28 09:28 /dev/sgx_enclave
```

and the user running Oasis Node is `oasis`, you can do:

```bash
sudo adduser oasis sgx
```

Failure to do so may result in the "permission denied OS error 13" during
runtime startup.

If you are planning to run your node from an interactive session, make sure to
log out for permissions to take effect.

### AESM Service

To allow execution of SGX enclaves, several **Architectural Enclaves (AE)** are
involved (i.e. Launch Enclave, Provisioning Enclave, Provisioning Certificate
Enclave, Quoting Enclave, Platform Services Enclaves).

Communication between application-spawned SGX enclaves and Intel-provided
Architectural Enclaves is through **Application Enclave Service Manager
(AESM)**. AESM runs as a daemon and provides a socket through which applications
can facilitate various SGX services such as launch approval, remote attestation
quote signing, etc.

Oasis node requires the use of DCAP attestation. To see if your system supports
it, run the following:

```bash
 cpuid -1  | grep "SGX"
 ```

and look for the following line:
```
      SGX_LC: SGX launch config supported      = true
```

### DCAP Attestation

#### Ubuntu 22.04+

A convenient way to install the AESM service on Ubuntu 22.04 systems
is to use the Intel's [official Intel SGX APT repository](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/).

First add Intel SGX APT repository to your system:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/intel-sgx-deb.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/intel-sgx-deb.gpg] https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-sgx.list > /dev/null
```

And then install the `sgx-aesm-service`, `libsgx-aesm-ecdsa-plugin`, `libsgx-aesm-quote-ex-plugin` and `libsgx-dcap-default-qpl` packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sgx-aesm-service libsgx-aesm-ecdsa-plugin libsgx-aesm-quote-ex-plugin libsgx-dcap-default-qpl
```

The AESM service should be up and running. To confirm that, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl status aesmd.service
```

#### Configuring the Quote Provider

The Intel Quote Provider (`libsgx-dcap-default-qpl`) needs to be configured in
order to use either the Intel PCS, the PCCS of your cloud service provider, or
your own PCCS. The configuration file is located at `/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf`.

Make sure to always restart the `aesmd.service` after updating the
configuration, via:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart aesmd.service
```

##### Intel PCS

Using the Intel PCS is the simplest and most generic way, but it may be less
reliable than using your own PCCS. Some cloud providers (see the [following section](#cloud-service-providers-pccs))
also require you to use their PCCS.

To use Intel PCS update the `pccs_url` value in `/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf`
to the Intel PCS API URL:

```json
  //PCCS server address
  "pccs_url": "https://api.trustedservices.intel.com/sgx/certification/v4/"
```

:::tip

In case there is an error in the QPL configuration file, attestation will refuse
to work and the AESM service may produce unhelpful errors like the following:

```
Couldn't find the platform library. (null)
```

The only thing that needs to be changed is the `pccs_url` value above. **Do not
add any comments and/or modify punctuation as these could make the configuration
file invalid.**

:::

##### Cloud Service Provider's PCCS

Some cloud providers require you to use their PCCS.

- Azure: See the [Azure documentation] for details on configuring the quote provider. The documentation
  contains an example of an Intel QPL configuration file that can be used.

- Alibaba Cloud: See the [Alibaba Cloud documentation] for details on configuring the quote provider. The
  documentation shows the required `sgx_default_qcnl.conf` changes.

- IBM Cloud: See the [IBM Cloud documentation] for details on configuring the quote provider. The
  documentation shows the required `sgx_default_qcnl.conf` changes.

- Other cloud providers: If you are using a different cloud service provider, consult their
specific documentation for the appropriate PCCS configuration and guidance on configuring the quote provider, or
use one of the other PCCS options.

[Azure documentation]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/trusted-hardware-identity-management#how-do-i-use-intel-qpl-with-trusted-hardware-identity-management
[Alibaba Cloud documentation]: https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ecs/user-guide/build-an-sgx-encrypted-computing-environment
[IBM Cloud documentation]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-attestation-sgx-dcap-vpc

##### Own PCCS

It is also possible to run PCCS yourself. Follow [official Intel instructions] on how to setup your own PCCS.

[official Intel Instructions]: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/intel-software-guard-extensions-data-center-attestation-primitives-quick-install-guide.html

#### DCAP Attestation Docker

Alternatively, an easy way to install and run the AESM service on a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)-enabled
system is to use [our AESM container image](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/pkgs/container/aesmd).

Executing the following command should (always) pull the latest version of our
AESMD Docker container, map the SGX devices and `/var/run/aesmd` directory
and ensure AESM is running in the background (also automatically started on boot):

```bash
docker run \
  --pull always \
  --detach \
  --restart always \
  --device /dev/sgx_enclave \
  --device /dev/sgx_provision \
  --volume /var/run/aesmd:/var/run/aesmd \
  --name aesmd \
  ghcr.io/oasisprotocol/aesmd-dcap:master
```

By default, the Intel Quote Provider in the docker container is configured to use the Intel PCS endpoint.
To override the Intel Quote Provider configuration within the container mount your own custom configuration using
the `volume` flag.

```bash
docker run \
  --pull always \
  --detach \
  --restart always \
  --device /dev/sgx_enclave \
  --device /dev/sgx_provision \
  --volume /var/run/aesmd:/var/run/aesmd \
  --volume /etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf:/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf \
  --name aesmd \
  ghcr.io/oasisprotocol/aesmd-dcap:master
```

The default Intel Quote Provider config is available in [Intel SGX Github repository](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/blob/master/QuoteGeneration/qcnl/linux/sgx_default_qcnl.conf).

#### Multi-socket Systems

Note that platform provisioning for multi-socket systems (e.g. systems with
multiple CPUs) is more complex, especially if one is using a hypervisor and
running SGX workloads inside guest VMs. In this case additional provisioning may
be required to be performed on the host.

Note that the system must be booted in UEFI mode for provisioning to work as the
provisioning process uses UEFI variables to communicate with the BIOS. In
addition the **SGX Auto MP Registration** BIOS configuration setting should be
set to _enabled_.

##### Ubuntu 22.04+

To provision and register your multi-socket system you need to install the Intel
SGX Multi-Package Registration Agent Service as follows (assuming Intel's SGX
apt repository has been added as discussed above):

```shell
sudo apt install sgx-ra-service
```

After boot, the log in `/var/log/mpa_registration.log` should indicate
successful registration. If an error is reported, make sure that you have
enabled SGX Auto MP Registration in the BIOS as mentioned above. You can also
perform re-provisioning by rebooting and setting the **SGX Factory Reset**
option to _enabled_.

##### VMware vSphere 8.0+

In order to enable SGX remote attestation on VMware vSphere-based systems,
please follow [the vSphere guide].

[the vSphere guide]: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-esxi-management/GUID-F16476FD-3B66-462F-B7FB-A456BEDC3549.html

### Migrate from EPID Attestation to DCAP Attestation

EPID attestation will be discontinued in 2025 and will no longer be available on
any processors. All nodes using EPID attestation must migrate to DCAP
attestation.

For transitioning to the DCAP attestation, follow these steps:
1. See if your system [supports DCAP attestation]. If your hardware does not
support DCAP attestation, you'll need to migrate your node to newer hardware.
2. Transition to DCAP attestation:
  - In case you are running AESM service on Docker follow [these instructions].
  - Otherwise manually configure AESM service to use DCAP attestation:
    1. Remove any leftover EPID attestation packages. If running on Ubuntu 22.04 run
      the following command:
      ```bash
        sudo apt remove libsgx-aesm-launch-plugin libsgx-aesm-epid-plugin
      ```
    2. Configure AESM service to use [DCAP attestation]
    3. Restart the AESM service. If running on Ubuntu 22.04 run the following
      command:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart aesmd.service
      ```
3. [Configure the Quote Provider].
4. Use the [attestation tool] to test if your settings are correct.
5. Restart your compute node and verify that node is `ready`.

## Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) {#tdx}

Before proceeding with the TDX installation, **make sure you followed the SGX
installation steps above and you have a working SGX environment**!

### BIOS configuration {#tdx-bios-configuration}

- **SGX**: ENABLE
- **SGX memory**: at least 256MB
- **SGX Auto MP Registration**: ENABLE
- **Hyper-Threading**: DISABLE
- **Intel SpeedStep**: DISABLE
- **SecureBoot**: DISABLE
- **All Internal Graphics**: DISABLE

### Host OS setup

The following section contains summarized instructions for setting up an
environment for running ROFL node and other TDX services on Ubuntu 24.04 or
later. Check out the official [Canonical TDX repository] for details.

[Canonical TDX repository]: https://github.com/canonical/tdx

1. Add the following TDX PPAs to your APT sources and the keyring:
   
   ```shell
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kobuk-team/tdx-release
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kobuk-team/tdx-attestation-release
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install the TDX quote generation service and QEMU for running
   guest virtual machines:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install tdx-qgs qemu-utils qemu-system-x86
    ```
   
3. Install a special TDX-enabled Linux kernel:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install linux-image-intel
    ```

3. Disable ACPI S3 (add kernel parameter: `nohibernate`):
 
   ```
   sed -i -E "s/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"(.*)\"/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\1 nohibernate\"/g" /etc/default/grub
   update-grub
   ```

4. Make sure the non-root user running Oasis-node is a member of `sgx`,
   `sgx_prv` and `kvm` groups on host (access to `/dev/sgx*`, `/dev/kvm*` and
   `/dev/*vsock*` devices).

5. Reboot your system and select the new `-intel` kernel.

:::tip

If you don't have access to the grub selector during machine startup, you can
also detect and set the correct default kernel by executing the script below
with elevated privileges:

```bash
export KERNEL_RELEASE=$(apt show "linux-image-intel" 2>&1 | gawk 'match($0, /Depends:.* linux-image-([^, ]+)/, a) {print a[1]}')
if [ -z "${KERNEL_RELEASE}" ]; then
    echo "ERROR : unable to determine kernel release"
    exit 1
fi
MID=$(awk '/Advanced options for Ubuntu/{print $(NF-1)}' /boot/grub/grub.cfg | cut -d\' -f2)
KID=$(awk "/with Linux $KERNEL_RELEASE/"'{print $(NF-1)}' /boot/grub/grub.cfg | cut -d\' -f2 | head -n1)
cat > /etc/default/grub.d/99-tdx-kernel.cfg <<EOF
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
EOF
grub-editenv /boot/grub/grubenv set saved_entry="${MID}>${KID}"
update-grub
```

:::

### Check TDX Setup

To check whether your system is ready to launch TDX VMs, you should see an
output like this:

```shell
sudo dmesg | grep -i tdx
```

```
