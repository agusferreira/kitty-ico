# Frequently Asked Questions

This documents answers frequently asked questions about the official Oasis and
3rd party wallets & custody providers supporting ROSE.

### How can I transfer ROSE tokens from my BitPie wallet to my ROSE Wallet?

:::caution

BitPie wallet doesn't use the [standardized Oasis mnemonic derivation (ADR-8)][ADR-8].
Consequently, your **Bitpie wallet's mnemonic phrase will not open the same
account in the ROSE Wallet**.

:::

In May 2023, the BitPie team [removed support for the Oasis
network][bitpie-announcement]. Thus, the only way to access your tokens stored
on your BitPie wallet is to obtain the private key of your BitPie's wallet in
one of the two ways:

- [Export private key from a working BitPie wallet](#how-can-i-export-oasis-private-key-from-a-working-bitpie-wallet)
- [Convert BitPie mnemonic to Oasis private key offline](#how-can-i-export-oasis-private-key-if-bitpie-doesnt-show-my-rose-account-anymore)

Once you obtained the private key, you can
[import it to the ROSE Wallet][rose-wallet-import-private-key] and access
your assets.

### How can I export Oasis private key from a working BitPie wallet?

:::tip

Chinese users can follow the [official BitPie support article] on how to export
the Oasis private key from your BitPie wallet.

[official BitPie support article]: https://bitpie.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/6796209839503

:::

If you have an existing ROSE account in your BitPie wallet, you can obtain the
wallet's private key by following the steps below.

On the main BitPie wallet screen, click on the "Receive" button.

![BitPie main screen](../images/wallet/bitpie/mainscreen.png)

The QR code with your ROSE address will appear. Then, in the top right corner,
tap on the kebab menu "â‹®" and select "Display Private Key"_._

![BitPie show private key](../images/wallet/bitpie/show_private_key.png)

BitPie wallet will now ask you to enter your PIN to access the private key.

Finally, your account's private key will be shown to you encoded in Base64
format (e.g.
`YgwGOfrHG1TVWSZBs8WM4w0BUjLmsbk7Gqgd7IGeHfSqdbeQokEhFEJxtc3kVQ4KqkdZTuD0bY7LOlhdEKevaQ==`)
which you can
[import into ROSE Wallet][rose-wallet-import-private-key].

### How can I export Oasis private key, if BitPie doesn't show my ROSE account anymore?

<!-- NOTE: This answer is similar to the Ledger answer below. Keep them in sync. -->

If you reinstalled BitPie or restored it with a mnemonic on a new device, you
may not have your ROSE account present anymore. In this case, you will have
to convert your BitPie mnemonic to the Oasis private key using the [Oasis
unmnemonic tool] (64-bit binaries available for [Linux][unmnemonic-linux],
[MacOS][unmnemonic-macos] and [Windows][unmnemonic-windows]).

Open a terminal (on Windows run `cmd`), move to the corresponding folder and
invoke the unmnemonic executable:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Linux">

```shell
./unmnemonic_linux_amd64
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="MacOS">

```shell
./unmnemonic_darwin_all
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows">

```shell
unmnemonic_windows_amd64
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

An interactive prompt will be shown to you:

1. select the **Bitpie** algorithm,
2. enter the number of words in the mnemonic (typically **12**) and carefully
   type them in one by line,
3. enter the private key index (start with **0** and gradually increase it by 1,
   if the resulting account does not contain any tokens),
4. answer **Yes** for writing the keys to disk,
5. enter the name of the **output directory** to store the Oasis private key
   into (by default the folder name starts with `wallet-export-`)

For example:

```
  unmnemonic - Recover Oasis Network signing keys from mnemonics

? Which algorithm does your wallet use Bitpie
? How many words is your mnemonic 12
? Enter word 1 *****
? Enter word 2 ******
? Enter word 3 ******
? Enter word 4 *******
? Enter word 5 *****
? Enter word 6 *******
? Enter word 7 *******
? Enter word 8 ****
? Enter word 9 *****
? Enter word 10 ******
? Enter word 11 *****
? Enter word 12 ******
? Wallet index(es) (comma separated) 0
 Index[0]: oasis1qp8d9kuduq0zutuatjsgltpugxvl38cuaq3gzkmn
? Write the keys to disk Yes
? Output directory /home/user/unmnemonic/wallet-export-2023-05-01
 Index[0]: oasis1qp8d9kuduq0zutuatjsgltpugxvl38cuaq3gzkmn.private.pem - done
Done writing wallet keys to disk, goodbye.
```

Finally, look into the output directory. There you should find a `.private.pem`
file containing the private key and named after the address it belongs to. You
can either:

- Open it with a text editor, copy the Base64-encoded key between the
`-----BEGIN ED25519 PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END ED25519 PRIVATE KEY-----`,
and [paste it into the ROSE Wallet][rose-wallet-import-private-key], or
- if you use the [Oasis CLI] simply execute the [`oasis wallet import-file`]
  command to add the exported account to your CLI wallet, for example:

  ![code shell](../../../external/cli/examples/wallet/import-file-unmnemonic.in.static)

[unmnemonic-macos]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/tools/releases/download/unmnemonic-tool-0.1.0/unmnemonic_darwin_all
[`oasis wallet import-file`]: cli/wallet.md#import-file

### Chromium under Ubuntu does not recognize my Ledger device. What is the problem?

First check that you added the Ledger udev device descriptors as mentioned in
the [Linux installation guide]. Next, check that your Ledger wallet is
recognized by the [Oasis CLI]. You should be able to add your Ledger account to
the Oasis CLI wallet by running:

![code shell](../../../external/cli/examples/wallet/create.in.static)

If all of the above works, then the issue is most likely that Chromium does not
have the permission to access your Ledger device. Starting with Ubuntu 20.04 the
Chromium browser is installed via snap package by default. Snap is more
convenient for upstream developers to deploy their software and it also adds
additional layer of security by using apparmor. In our case however, it prevents
Chromium to access arbitrary USB devices with WebUSB API including your Ledger
device. A workaround for this issue is to install Chromium natively using the
official [Chormium beta PPA] or the official [Google Chrome .deb package].

### Are Ethereum and ROSE Wallet that different? I can use the same mnemonics with both, right?

Yes, both ROSE and Ethereum wallets make use of the mnemonics as defined in [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) and they even use the same wordlist to derive the keypairs for your wallet. However, they use a different **signature scheme and a derivation path**, so the addresses and the private keys are incompatible.

Here's a task for you:

1. Visit [https://iancoleman.io/bip39/](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate a BIP39 mnemonic.
2. Select ETH token and copy the hex-encoded private key of the first derived account, for example `0xab2c4f3bc70d40f12f6030750fe452448b5464114cbfc46704edeef2cd06da74`.
3. Import the Ethereum-compatible account with the private key obtained above to your ROSE Wallet.
4. Notice the Ethereum address of the account, for example `0x58c72Eb040Dd0DF10882aA87a39851c21Ae5F331`.
5. Now in the Account management screen, select this account and click on the "Export private key" button. Confirm the risk warning.
6. You will notice the private key of the Ethereum-compatible account, the hex-encoded address and the very same address encoded in the Oasis Bech32 format, in our case `oasis1qpaj6hznytpvyvalmsdg8vw5fzlpftpw7g7ku0h0`.
7. Now let's use the private key from step 2 to import the account. First, convert the hex-encoded key to base64 format, for example by using [this service](https://base64.guru/converter/encode/hex). In our example, that would be `qyxPO8cNQPEvYDB1D+RSRItUZBFMv8RnBO3u8s0G2nQ=`.
8. Next, import this base64-encoded private key to the ROSE Wallet Browser Extension.
9. You should see your newly imported account and the Oasis address. In our case `oasis1qzaf9zd8rlmchywmkkqmy00wrczstugfxu9q09ng`.
10. Observe that this account address **is different** than the Bech32-encoded version of the Ethereum-compatible address despite using the same private key to import the wallet with, because of a different _signature scheme_.

As an additional exercise, you can also create an Oasis account using the BIP39 mnemonic from the step 1 above. You will notice that the imported account's base64-encoded private key in the account details screen is different from the one in step 7 above. That's because Oasis uses a different _derivation path_ than Ethereum.

### Which derivation path should I use on Ledger? ADR-8 or Legacy? {#ledger-derivation-paths}

To convert your mnemonic phrase into a private key for signing transactions,
each wallet (hardware or software) performs a *key derivation*. The Oasis
Protocol Foundation standardized the key derivation for the official ROSE Wallet
in a document called [ADR-8] back in January 2021. However, the Ledger
hardware wallet already supported signing transactions at that time using a
custom (we now call it *legacy*) derivation path which is incompatible with
the one defined in ADR-8. Later, in Oasis app for Ledger v2.3.1 support for
ADR-8 was added so the wallet can request either derivation from the Ledger
device.

The key derivation path defined in ADR-8 has the following advantages
compared to the legacy one:

- Derivation path is shorter which results in approximately twice as fast
  key derivation (and transaction signing) without compromising security.
- In case your Ledger device is broken or lost and you are unable to retrieve
  a new one, you will be able to import your Ledger mnemonic and restore your
  private key in a ROSE Wallet which implements ADR-8.

For reasons above, we recommend the usage of ADR-8. However, since there are
no security considerations at stake, the ROSE Wallet will support legacy
derivation on Ledger for the foreseeable future.

### I lost my Ledger or my Ledger is broken. I urgently need to access my assets. Can I import Ledger mnemonic into ROSE Wallet?

<!-- NOTE: This answer is similar to the BitPie answer above. Keep them in sync. -->

:::danger

When you import your Ledger mnemonic to a software wallet, consider
that mnemonic *potentially exposed/compromised*, i.e. not appropriate for a
hardware wallet mnemonic anymore. If you use a new hardware wallet in the
future, **never restore it from the mnemonic that was previously used by any
software wallet!**

:::

Ledger supports [two derivation paths](#ledger-derivation-paths) on the Oasis
network.

If you used your Ledger with the [Oasis CLI] and the [ADR-8] derivation path,
you can import the mnemonic directly into the CLI wallet by invoking
[`oasis wallet import`] and selecting the `ed25519-adr8` algorithm.

If you used your Ledger with the ROSE Wallet Web, the browser extension, the
Oasis CLI with the `ed25519-legacy` derivation path or the Oasis Core, then you
will need to use the [Oasis unmnemonic tool] (64-bit binaries available for
[Linux][unmnemonic-linux], [MacOS][unmnemonic-macos] and
[Windows][unmnemonic-windows]).

Open a terminal (on Windows run `cmd`), move to the corresponding folder and
invoke the unmnemonic executable:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Linux">

```shell
./unmnemonic_linux_amd64
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="MacOS">

```shell
./unmnemonic_darwin_all
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows">

```shell
unmnemonic_windows_amd64
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

An interactive prompt will be shown to you:

1. select the **Ledger** algorithm,
2. enter the number of words in the mnemonic (typically **24**) and carefully
   type them in one by line,
3. enter the private key index (start with **0** and gradually increase it by 1,
   if the resulting account does not contain any tokens),
4. answer **Yes** for writing the keys to disk,
5. enter the name of the **output directory** to store the Oasis private key
   into (by default the folder name starts with `wallet-export-`)

For example:

```
  unmnemonic - Recover Oasis Network signing keys from mnemonics

? Which algorithm does your wallet use Ledger
 WARNING:

  Entering your Ledger device mnemonic into any non-Leger device
  can COMPROMISE THE SECURITY OF ALL ACCOUNTS TIED TO THE MNEMONIC.

 Index[4]: oasis1qqwkm23pyg638xvl2nu00frxhapusjjv8qhh3p77.private.pem - done
Done writing wallet keys to disk, goodbye.
```

Finally, look into the output directory. There you should find a `.private.pem`
file containing the private key and named after the address it belongs to. You
can either:

- Open it with a text editor, copy the Base64-encoded key between the
  `-----BEGIN ED25519 PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END ED25519 PRIVATE KEY-----`,
  and [paste it into the ROSE Wallet][rose-wallet-import-private-key], or
- if you use the [Oasis CLI] simply execute the [`oasis wallet import-file`]
  command to add the exported account to your CLI wallet, for example:

  ![code shell](../../../external/cli/examples/wallet/import-file-unmnemonic.in.static)

[`oasis wallet import`]: cli/wallet.md#import

### The wallet gives me _Invalid keyphrase_ error when importing my wallet from mnemonics. How do I solve it?

Please check that:

* All mnemonics were spelled correctly. The ROSE Wallet uses English mnemonic phrase words as defined in BIP39. You can find a complete list of valid phrase words [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).
* The mnemonics were input in correct order.
* All mnemonics were provided. The keyphrase should be either 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 words long.

If you checked all of the above and the keyphrase still cannot be imported, please contact Oasis support.

### I imported my wallet with mnemonics. The wallet should contain funds, but the balance is empty. What can I do?

First, check your wallet address. If the address equals the one that you
expected your funds on, then the key derivation from mnemonics worked correctly.
Make sure you have a working internet connection so that the wallet can fetch
the latest balance. Then check that the correct network (Mainnet or Testnet) is
selected. These are completely separated networks and although the wallet
address can be the same, the transactions and consequently the balances may
differ. Finally, there might be a temporary problem with the
[Oasis Explorer backend](https://explorer.oasis.io) itself which observes the network
and indexes transactions. The ROSE Wallet relies on that service and once it is
back up and running, you should be able to see the correct balance.

If your wallet address is different than the one you used to transfer your funds
to, then you used one of the wallets that don't implement the [standardized key
derivation path][ADR-8]. If you were using the BitPie wallet see
[this question](#how-can-i-export-oasis-private-key-from-a-working-bitpie-wallet).
Ledger hardware wallet users should refer to
[this question](#ledger-derivation-paths).

If you still cannot access your funds, please contact Oasis support on [#wallets
Discord channel][discord].

### I sent my ROSE to BinanceStaking address.  Are they staked? Are they lost? What can I do?

If you just make a **Send** transaction to BinanceStaking address `oasis1qqekv2ymgzmd8j2s2u7g0hhc7e77e654kvwqtjwm` then your ROSE coins are not staked. They are now owned by BinanceStaking, which means they are not lost but only owned and managed by them. In this case, you should contact Binance via their [Support Center](https://www.binance.com/en/support) or [Submit a request](https://www.binance.com/en/chat).

:::info

Sending ROSE is different than staking it! With the staking transaction you **lend** your ROSE to the chosen validator and you are rewarded for that. **Sending** your ROSE to the receiving address you enter means that only the person who owns the private key (e.g. mnemonics) of that receiving address can manage these tokens and no one else. To learn more, read the [Staking and Delegating chapter](staking-and-delegating.md).

:::

### I withdrew ROSE from Emerald to an exchange (Binance, KuCoin), but my deposit is not there. What should I do?

Withdrawals from Emerald are slightly different from regular `staking.Transfer` transactions used to send ROSE on the consensus layer. If you withdrew your ROSE directly to an exchange and you were not funded there, contact the exchange support and provide them the link to your account on the [Oasis Scan](https://www.oasisscan.com) where they can verify all transactions. To learn more about this issue, read the [Manage tokens](README.mdx) chapter.
