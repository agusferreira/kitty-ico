# Custody Providers & Protocols

Another way to hold your ROSE is by involving custodial partnersâ€”either
by giving them complete custody over your tokens
([Custody Providers](#custody-providers)) or just require a multi-signature
transaction to move them and then splitting some of those keys among trusted
parties ([Decentralized Custody Protocols](#decentralized-custody-protocols)).
We've partnered with industry-leaders who support a number of top crypto
assets. You can pick among the custodial providers or decentralized custody
protocols below.
