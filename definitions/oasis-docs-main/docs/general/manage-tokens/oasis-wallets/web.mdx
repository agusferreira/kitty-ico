# ROSE Wallet - Web

This is the Oasis Foundation-managed non-custodial web wallet for the Oasis
Network. You can access it by visiting **[wallet.oasis.io](https://wallet.oasis.io)**.

![Home screen](../../images/wallet/web/home.png)

:::note

The wallet was designed to work with any modern browser. In order to use the
[Ledger hardware wallet](../holding-rose-tokens/ledger-wallet.md) though, **you
will need the WebUSB support**. At time of writing, this was only available in
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and other
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)-based browsers.

:::

Opening the wallet for the first time will show the *Home screen* where you can
choose to [create a new account](#create-a-new-account) or
[open an existing one](#import-an-existing-account).


## Create a New Account

The next screen is devoted to your mnemonic—**a unique list of
words representing your account(s)**. Review the information on this page very
carefully. Save your
mnemonic in the right order in a secure location.

:::caution

Your mnemonic (i.e. keyphrase) is required to access your wallet. Be sure to
store it in a secure location. If you lose or forget your mnemonic, you will
lose access to your wallet and any token funds contained in it.

:::

:::danger Never share your mnemonic (i.e. keyphrase)!

Anyone with your mnemonic can access your wallet and your tokens.

:::

After you’ve saved your mnemonic, click the “I saved my keyphrase” checkbox and
then click on the “Import my wallet” button.

![Create a New Wallet](../../images/wallet/web/create_new_wallet_mnemonic1.png)

Next, you will need to confirm your mnemonic by writing the mnemonic into the
text area. The ROSE Wallet will check for any typos and missing words. When
done click the "Import my wallet" button.

![Confirm your mnemonic](../../images/wallet/web/create_new_wallet_mnemonic2.png)

### Account Derivation

If you correctly entered the mnemonic the **account derivation popup**
will appear containing a list of `oasis1` addresses with their
balances on the right. These are the accounts derived from your
mnemonic based on the [ADR-8 derivation scheme][adr8]. Select one or more
accounts and click the "Open" button to import them into your wallet.

![Account derivation popup](../../images/wallet/web/create_new_wallet_select_accounts.png)

### User Profile

If you want to permanently store the keys of selected accounts, turn on the "Create a profile" toggle button below, which will Store your private keys locally and protect them with a password by creating a profile.
After entering a password below, this will **instantiate a profile inside the local store of your
browser to safely store your keys**. To access them, you will need to enter the correct
password each time you will open the ROSE Wallet - Web.

Finally, you will be taken to the *Wallet screen*, containing
information about your account balance, recent transactions and more.

## Import an Existing Account

On the "Open wallet" page select whether you want to open your
wallet via a mnemonic, a private key, or a Ledger hardware wallet.

![Access an Existing Wallet](../../images/wallet/web/import_wallet.png)

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Mnemonic">

In the "Enter your mnemonic here" field, enter each word of your mnemonic
separated by a space. Then, hit the "Import my wallet" button.

![Open Wallet via Mnemonic](../../images/wallet/web/import_wallet_mnemonic.png)

The [account derivation popup](#account-derivation) will be shown where
you can pick one or more derived accounts to import.

:::info

The ROSE Wallet uses English mnemonic phrase words as defined in
[BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).
You can find a complete list of all valid phrase words
[here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).
If you misspelled a word, the wallet will warn you.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Private Key">

Paste your Base64-encoded Ed25519 private key in the "Enter your private key
here" field and then click on the "Import my wallet" button.

![Open Wallet via Private Key](../../images/wallet/web/import_wallet_private_key.png)

Toggling on "Create a profile" will store private keys locally, protected by a password and instantiate
the [user's profile](#user-profile).

:::tip

The 64 bytes long keypair is the preferred format for importing your account. It
consists of **two 32-byte parts**:

1. The first part is the **private key** used for signing the transactions
   (e.g. for sending tokens from your account).
2. The second part is a **public key** used to verify the signatures
   of your transactions and also derive your account's address of the form
   `oasis1...`.

:::

:::caution

If you entered the 64-byte keypair then the wallet checks whether the public
key corresponds to its private counterpart. **If you mistyped any character, the
wallet will not allow you to proceed.**

However, if you only typed in the first 32-byte part there is **no error
detection possible. It is imperative that you **correctly input all characters**
and not mix similar characters like the big O and 0 or big I and 1! If unsure,
we suggest that you perform a test transaction the first time you import your
wallet from the private key so you can rest assured the key is valid.
