# ROSE Wallet - Browser Extension

## Installation

:::info

Currently, the [ROSE Wallet - Browser Extension](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/wallet)
**only supports** [**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or other
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)-based browsers.

:::

You can install the ROSE Wallet - Browser Extension by heading to the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oasis-wallet/ppdadbejkmjnefldpcdjhnkpbjkikoip).

![ROSE Wallet Extension - chrome web store](../../images/wallet/ext/chrome_web_store.png)

Next, either [create a new wallet](#create-a-new-account) or
[restore your existing one](#import-an-existing-account).

## Create a New Account

The next screen is devoted to your mnemonic—**a unique list of
words representing your account(s)**. Review the information on this page very
carefully. Save your
mnemonic in the right order in a secure location.

:::caution

Your mnemonic (i.e. keyphrase) is required to access your wallet. Be sure to
store it in a secure location. If you lose or forget your mnemonic, you will
lose access to your wallet and any token funds contained in it.

:::

:::danger Never share your mnemonic (i.e. keyphrase)!

Anyone with your mnemonic can access your wallet and your tokens.

:::

After you’ve saved your mnemonic, click the “I saved my keyphrase” checkbox and
then click on the “Import my wallet” button.

![Create a New
  Wallet](../../images/wallet/ext/create_new_wallet_mnemonic1.png)

Next, you will need to confirm your mnemonic by writing the mnemonic into the
text area. The ROSE Wallet will check for any typos and missing words. When
done click the "Import my wallet" button.

![Confirm your
  mnemonic](../../images/wallet/ext/create_new_wallet_mnemonic2.png)

### Account Derivation

If you correctly entered the mnemonic the **account derivation popup**
will appear containing a list of `oasis1` addresses with their
balances on the right. These are the accounts derived from your
mnemonic based on the [ADR-8 derivation scheme][adr8]. Select one or more
accounts and click the "Open" button to import them into your wallet.

![Account derivation](../../images/wallet/ext/account_derivation.png)

### User Profile

If you want to permanently store the keys of selected accounts, turn on the "Create a profile" toggle button below, which will Store your private keys locally and protect them with a password by creating a profile.
After entering a password below, this will **instantiate a profile inside the local store of your
browser to safely store your keys**. To access them, you will need to enter the correct
password each time you will open the ROSE Wallet - Chrome extension.

![Create a profile](../../images/wallet/ext/create_profile.png)

After clicking the 'Open' button, you will be taken to the _Wallet screen_, containing
information about your account balance, recent transactions and more.

## Import an Existing Account

On the "Open wallet" page select whether you want to open your
wallet via a mnemonic, a private key, or a Ledger hardware wallet.

![Access an Existing Wallet](../../images/wallet/ext/import_wallet.png)

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Mnemonic">

In the "Enter your mnemonic here" field, enter each word of your mnemonic
separated by a space. Then, hit the "Import my wallet" button.

![Open Wallet via
  Mnemonic](../../images/wallet/ext/import_wallet_mnemonic.png)

The [account derivation popup](#account-derivation) will be shown where
you can pick one or more derived accounts to import.

:::info

The ROSE Wallet uses English mnemonic phrase words as defined in
[BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).
You can find a complete list of all valid phrase words
[here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).
If you misspelled a word, the wallet will warn you.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Private Key">

Paste your Base64-encoded Ed25519 private key in the "Enter your private key
here" field and then click on the "Import my wallet" button.

![Open Wallet via Private
  Key](../../images/wallet/ext/import_wallet_private_key.png)

Toggling on "Create a profile" will store private keys locally, protected by a password and instantiate
the [user's profile](#user-profile).

:::tip

The 64 bytes long keypair is the preferred format for importing your account. It
consists of **two 32-byte parts**:

1. The first part is the **private key** used for signing the transactions
   (e.g. for sending tokens from your account).
2. The second part is a **public key** used to verify the signatures
   of your transactions and also derive your account's address of the form
   `oasis1...`.

:::

:::caution

If you entered the 64-byte keypair then the wallet checks whether the public
key corresponds to its private counterpart. **If you mistyped any character, the
wallet will not allow you to proceed.**

However, if you only typed in the first 32-byte part there is **no error
detection possible. It is imperative that you **correctly input all characters**
and not mix similar characters like the big O and 0 or big I and 1! If unsure,
we suggest that you perform a test transaction the first time you import your
wallet from the private key so you can rest assured the key is valid.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Ledger">

To use the Ledger hardware wallet, make sure you have your Ledger device readily
available and have familiarized yourself with the [Oasis-specific Ledger usage instructions](../holding-rose-tokens/ledger-wallet.md).

Click on your Ledger device. Then click "Connect Ledger device".

Next, click on the "Select accounts to open". If this is the first time you're
using Ledger with your browser, a system popup will appear showing the list of
Ledger devices connected to your computer and requesting permission to use it.
Select one and then click the "Connect" button.
